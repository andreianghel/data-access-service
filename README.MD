Project Name: collaborative online notepad 

Description: ensemble of microservices that offer a functionality of a notepad;
Async communication between the front end and backend, so as to facilitate multiple user usage;

Logical components:

- UI: for now, just a REST Api, a real gui will be made with thymeleaf or flask;
-> future development, the ui will use web sockets or somehow pool for new messages and display them.

- UI service: gets requests from the user and puts the requests on a kafka topic; receives messages from the broker and sends them to the gui;

- messaging broker: used to move messages from components;

- data access service: get messages and stores entries, query the ES, etc.; pushes responses back to the topic;

- persistence: used mainly for persistence and the fuzzy query feature;

- (future) user action analytics: collects data about the users actions and stores them to be later procesed;



Under the hood: clasical Netflix cloud components: Eureka for service discovery, Zuul for routing and filtering, Spring boot for everything, Kafka for messaging, ElasticSearch for persistence and quering;

TO DO:

[X] add service discovery and api gateway

[] implement the services/expose basic rest;

[]

[] Dockerize every component;

[] docker stack all;

[] implement the gui;

[] deploy on cloud;

[] enrich the user posible actions

[] create and integrate the user analytics
